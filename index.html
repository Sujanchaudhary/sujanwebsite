				 At that moment i was very very happy beacause that was my greatest achievement. My intenttion was not to be topper but i worked hard to which pays off. i used read for at least of six hour per day which helps me a lot to be topper. my daily routine was go college and after college eat food and rest for some time and start to read for 2-3 hours and after that i went out for refreshment and at 7 0'clock i eat dinner and rest for like 30  minutes and then again i start to read and practice up to 10 pm and than after reading i go to bed and have some time in browsing social media like youtube,facebook etc.
